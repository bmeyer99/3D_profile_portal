### Phase 1: Requirements Analysis and Design

#### Step 1: Review and Finalize Concepts
1. **Concept Validation**: Conduct initial concept validation through brainstorming sessions with the team.
2. **Technology Stack Selection**: Finalize the technology stack including frontend, backend, and database frameworks.
3. **API Endpoints Definition**: Define a list of API endpoints required for user management, profile management, and rating system.

#### Step 2: Design Mockups
1. **Wireframes Creation**: Create wireframes using tools like Figma or Adobe XD to outline the basic structure of the application.
2. **Mockups Development**: Develop detailed mockups for the user interface, ensuring they are minimalist and modern in design.
3. **User Experience (UX) Review**: Present the mockups to stakeholders for feedback and make necessary adjustments.

#### Step 3: Define User Roles
1. **Role Identification**: Identify different user roles (e.g., regular users, administrators).
2. **Permission Definition**: Define specific permissions for each role, ensuring they align with the application's requirements.
3. **Role Mapping**: Map these roles and permissions to the corresponding frontend components and backend logic.

#### Step 4: Use Cases
1. **Use Case Identification**: Identify key use cases that will drive the functionality of the application (e.g., user registration, profile creation, rating a model).
2. **Detailed Use Case Creation**: Create detailed use case documents for each identified use case, including actors, preconditions, and post-conditions.
3. **Review and Approval**: Review the use case documents with stakeholders and obtain their approval.

### Deliverables
1. **Concept Document**: A document outlining the final concepts, technology stack, and API endpoints.
2. **Wireframes**: Wireframes of the application's user interface.
3. **Mockups**: Detailed mockups of the user interface.
4. **User Role Definitions**: A document detailing different user roles and their permissions.
5. **Use Case Documents**: Detailed use case documents for all identified use cases.

### Next Steps
1. **Concept Validation**: Conduct initial concept validation through brainstorming sessions with the team.
2. **Technology Stack Finalization**: Finalize the technology stack including frontend, backend, and database frameworks.
3. **API Endpoints Definition**: Define a list of API endpoints required for user management, profile management, and rating system.
