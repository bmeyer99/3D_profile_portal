# 3D Printer Profiles Portal

## Objective
Create a web application where users can share and compare their 3D printer profiles, filament types, and print settings.

## Design Requirements

* Clean minimalist design
* Responsive and mobile-first interface
* Modern design trends and patterns (Material-Design, Bootstrap, Tailwind CSS)
* Intuitive user experience

## Features

### User Profile Management

* Upload and share 3D printer profiles
* Store and display filament types and print settings
* Commenting system (using Disqus or similar library)
* Rating system (using a rating library like StarRating)
* Notification system (using Node-Socket.IO, Pusher, or Socket.io-client)

### Follow System

* Users can follow other users to stay updated on their activity
* Relationship.js or Follow.js for implementing the follow feature

### Image and Video Gallery

* Use PhotoSwipe or similar library for responsive image galleries
* Embed video content using Video.js

### Storage System

* Amazon S3 or Google Cloud Storage for hosting user-uploaded files

### Analysis and Visualization

* Use Plotly or similar library for creating interactive visualizations

## Technical Requirements

* Containerization (Docker) for deploying application containers
* Self-hosting vs cloud hosting (AWS, Google Cloud, Azure)
* Hybrid approach using self-hosted static assets and cloud-hosted dynamic content
* Use of frameworks:
    + Next.js or NestJS for building scalable backend APIs
    + Django or similar framework for building robust applications

## Development Approach

* Iterative development with many small deployments along the way
* No coding until everything is finalized
* Technical decisions will be made as needed, but design decisions should only be made when necessary

## Next Steps

1. Review and finalize all concepts, frameworks, and features.
2. Start implementing containerization using Docker.
3. Set up self-hosting vs cloud hosting infrastructure.
