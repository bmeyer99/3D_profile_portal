# 3D Printer Profiles Portal Project Plan

## Phase 1: Requirements Analysis and Design
1. **Review and Finalize Concepts**: Ensure all concepts, frameworks, and features are finalized.
2. **Design Mockups**: Create wireframes and mockups for the user interface to ensure it meets the minimalist and modern design requirements.
3. **Define User Roles**: Identify different user roles (e.g., regular users, administrators) and their permissions.

## Phase 2: Infrastructure Setup
1. **Containerization**: Set up Docker containers for deploying application components.
2. **Hosting Strategy**: Decide between self-hosting or cloud hosting (AWS, Google Cloud, Azure).
3. **Database Selection**: Choose a database that doesn't rely on native binaries (e.g., SQLite, libsql).

## Phase 3: Frontend Development
1. **Framework Selection**: Choose a frontend framework (e.g., React, Vue.js) for building the user interface.
2. **Component Design**: Break down the UI into reusable components (e.g., ProfileCard, RatingSystem).
3. **Styling**: Implement minimalist and modern styling using CSS frameworks like Tailwind CSS or Material-UI.

## Phase 4: Backend Development
1. **Framework Selection**: Choose a backend framework (e.g., Next.js, NestJS) for building APIs.
2. **API Design**: Define RESTful API endpoints for user management, profile management, and rating system.
3. **Authentication and Authorization**: Implement user authentication and authorization using JWT or similar mechanisms.

## Phase 5: Integration
1. **Frontend-Backend Integration**: Connect the frontend components to the backend APIs.
2. **Third-party Integrations**: Integrate with MakerWorld, Thingiverse, and MyMiniFactory for model linking.
3. **Gcode Analysis**: Plan for future integration of Gcode analysis (post-MVP).

## Phase 6: Testing and Deployment
1. **Unit and Integration Tests**: Write tests for both frontend and backend components.
2. **Deployment**: Deploy the application using Docker containers to the chosen hosting environment.

### Next Steps
1. **Design Mockups**: Create wireframes and mockups for the user interface.
2. **Define User Roles**: Identify different user roles and their permissions.
3. **Containerization Setup**: Set up Docker containers for deploying application components.
4. **Framework Selection**: Choose frontend and backend frameworks.
