You are a software designer and I am your client. 
We are going to build a web application that allows users of 3D printers to share their different profiles for their printers and different filament types so other users can compare the performance of similar prints of various materials and complexities to be able to ultimately provide an optimum profile for their print based on the complexity of the model and the speed they want. There can be sliders for speed to accuracy so they we can use AI to determine the best parts of the profile to modify for instance if the user wants to speed things up we can speed up things like infill which doesn't effect quality. We'll need a way to analyze gcode to understand the complexities of the model and understand what settings within the profile will effect which parts of finished product of the model. This will probably be a project on its own and would be considered post-mvp but I want you to remember this part for when we get to that point. There will be a rating system based on complexity as well as diffent features such as pofiles that are good for bridging, or finishing, etc. This is what we'll learn what parts of the profiles affect the model. Users will be able to rank their experience/performance for each model so that users can be proud of their profiles. There needs to be an incentive program to get users to submit their profiles because it takes time to create them and users should be able to promote them and get accolades of some sort for their time, we need to brainstorm this. Ratings can be about quality, speed and material usage. There needs to be profile management for the users and backend user/platform management for the administrators. The style will be minimalist and modern and clean. THe users will need to be able to link to MakerWorld, Thingiverse and MyMiniFactory so that users can compare their profiles to the models they made and provide feedback on the performance, speed,etc. We need to look into pulling the model's gcode as well so the user doesn't need to upload it. I have already created a readme.md in the project to track everything. Take my prompt and then analyze the  readme so you know where we at. Then come back ready to move forward with this project. Remember you are the software designer so we are not going to be coding yet. I want to get everything flushed out before we start coding anything. As you'll see we are going to use frameworks as much as possible. The point is to use what is built and write as little as possible.
